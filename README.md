## ü§ù The Problem It Solves

BudgetIQ addresses multiple challenges in personal financial management:

- **Lack of Financial Visibility**: Provides comprehensive dashboards with intuitive visualizations that break down spending by category, track monthly trends, and highlight budget status in real-time.

- **Manual Expense Tracking**: Employs OCR and AI to automatically extract, categorize, and record transaction details from uploaded receipts, significantly reducing manual data entry.

- **Budget Planning Difficulties**: Analyzes historical transaction data to suggest personalized budget allocations across different categories, helping users create achievable financial plans.

- **Multi-Currency Complexity**: Handles automatic conversions, maintaining accurate financial records regardless of the currencies involved.

- **Lack of Predictive Insights**: Uses AI-powered prediction to analyze spending patterns and forecast future expenses, helping users prepare for upcoming financial obligations.

- **Financial Decision Support**: AI Assistant provides personalized responses to financial queries, offering guidance tailored to the user's specific financial situation and goals.

- **Language Barriers**: Includes support for English, Hindi, Malayalam, and Kannada, making financial management accessible to a diverse user base in India.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges We Faced

During development, we encountered several significant challenges:

- **Receipt Analysis Implementation**: Improving OCR accuracy for varied receipt formats required developing custom preprocessing pipelines and text parsing algorithms.

- **Multi-Currency Integration**: Building a reliable exchange rate system with fallbacks to ensure accurate currency conversions across multiple sources.

- **AI Assistant Knowledge Base**: Creating a balanced system between hardcoded financial knowledge and dynamic, context-aware responses.

- **Language Localization**: Developing accurate translations for complex financial terminology across multiple Indian languages.

- **React Component Performance**: Optimizing data-heavy dashboards with multiple charts to ensure responsive performance across devices.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Designing adaptive visualizations that transform based on screen size to maintain usability on smaller devices.

- **Data Security**: Implementing robust security measures including end-to-end encryption and secure third-party API integrations.
