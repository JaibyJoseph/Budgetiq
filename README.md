## Project Description
BudgetIQ is an intelligent financial management platform built to tackle the complexity of personal finance through artificial intelligence. In today's fast-paced world, managing expenses, tracking spending patterns, and making informed financial decisions has become increasingly challenging. BudgetIQ addresses these pain points by leveraging AI to transform complex financial data into actionable insights, providing users with a comprehensive yet intuitive financial management experience.

Our platform analyzes transaction patterns, predicts future expenses, and offers personalized recommendations tailored to each user's financial habits. With features ranging from automated receipt scanning to multi-currency support, BudgetIQ empowers users to take control of their financial health regardless of their financial literacy level.

## Why BudgetIQ?
- **Financial Visibility Gap**: Most people lack clear insight into their spending patterns and financial health
- **Manual Tracking Burden**: Traditional expense tracking is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Financial Literacy Barrier**: Complex financial planning requires expertise most users don't possess
- **Language Accessibility**: Many financial tools lack support for Indian languages, limiting accessibility
- **Decision Support**: Users need contextual guidance for making better financial choices

## Features

### Core Features
- **Smart Dashboard**: Interactive visualizations of spending patterns, budget status, and financial insights with real-time updates
- **AI-Powered Receipt Scanner**: Automatically extract and categorize data from uploaded receipts using computer vision and OCR
- **Intelligent Categorization**: Smart classification of transactions with machine learning algorithms that improve over time
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Seamless handling of transactions in multiple currencies with automatic conversion
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast future expenses based on historical spending patterns and seasonal trends

### User Experience
- **Personalized Financial Assistant**: AI chatbot providing contextual financial advice based on spending habits
